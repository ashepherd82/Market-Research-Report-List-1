<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silicon-Manganese Alloy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mn Content min. 65%</li><li>Mn Content below 65%</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Silicon-manganese alloy is classified into two main types based on the manganese (Mn) content. The first type is the Mn content min. 65% market, which represents alloys containing a minimum of 65% manganese. These alloys are highly desirable in the steel industry as they exhibit excellent strength and toughness, making them suitable for high-stress applications. The second type is the Mn content below 65% market, encompassing alloys with manganese content below the aforementioned threshold. These alloys are generally less strong but more cost-effective, making them suitable for specific applications where high strength is not a primary requirement.</p></p>
