<p><strong>The Crop Micronutrients Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Soil</li><li>Fertigation</li><li>Foliar</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The crop micronutrients market has several applications, including soil application, fertigation, and foliar application. In soil application, micronutrients are applied directly to the soil to replenish nutrient levels and improve soil fertility. Fertigation involves applying micronutrients to irrigation water, which is then delivered directly to the plant root system. This method ensures efficient nutrient uptake by the plants. Lastly, in foliar application, micronutrients are sprayed onto the leaves and absorbed directly by the plants, providing a quick nutrient boost. These applications play a vital role in improving crop yield and quality.</p></p>
