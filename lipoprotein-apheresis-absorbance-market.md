<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lipoprotein Apheresis Absorbance Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cellulose Gel</li><li>Sepharose</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lipoprotein Apheresis Absorbance is a medical procedure used to lower high levels of Lipoprotein A (Lp(a)) in patients with cardiovascular diseases. There are two types of absorbance materials used in this procedure: Cellulose Gel and Sepharose. Cellulose Gel is a porous absorbent that effectively removes Lp(a) particles from the blood. Sepharose is another absorbent material known for its high binding capacity to Lp(a) particles. Both Cellulose Gel and Sepharose are commonly used in Lipoprotein Apheresis Absorbance procedures to remove excessive Lp(a) and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.</p></p>
