<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cataphoresis Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cathodic</li><li>Anodic</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Cataphoresis material market types refer to the two different processes used in electrocoating of materials. Cathodic cataphoresis involves immersing the material to be coated in a bath containing positively charged paint particles, while the material itself is negatively charged. This results in the paint particles migrating towards the material and forming a coating. On the other hand, anodic cataphoresis reverses the polarity, with the material being positively charged and the paint particles negatively charged. Consequently, the paint particles move away from the material and form a protective coating.</p></p>
