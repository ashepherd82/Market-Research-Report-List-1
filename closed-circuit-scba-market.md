<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Closed-Circuit SCBA Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Pressure Open-Circuit SCBA</li><li>Low Pressure Open-Circuit SCBA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The closed-circuit SCBA market consists of two types: high pressure open-circuit SCBA and low pressure open-circuit SCBA. High pressure open-circuit SCBA operates by providing a constant flow of fresh air to the user from a compressed air cylinder, allowing them to breathe underwater or in hazardous environments. On the other hand, low pressure open-circuit SCBA relies on a demand regulator, which supplies air to the user only when they inhale. These types of SCBAs are commonly used in firefighting, rescue operations, and other situations where respiratory protection is crucial.</p></p>
