<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dynamic Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SPD</li><li>PDLC</li><li>Electrochromic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dynamic glass market comprises three main types: SPD (suspended particle device), PDLC (polymer dispersed liquid crystal), and electrochromic. SPD glass uses electric voltage to control the alignment of suspended particles, allowing the glass to transition between opaque and transparent states. PDLC glass consists of polymer and liquid crystal molecules that realign in response to an applied voltage, altering the glass opacity. Electrochromic glass utilizes an electrochemical reaction to darken or lighten the glass, providing varying degrees of translucency. These dynamic glass types offer adjustable transparency, allowing for efficient control of light and heat entering a space.</p></p>
