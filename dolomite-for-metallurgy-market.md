<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dolomite for Metallurgy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Raw Dolomite</li><li>Slightly Burnt Dolomite</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Dolomite is a mineral used in metallurgy, specifically in the production of iron and steel. There are two main types in the market: raw dolomite and slightly burnt dolomite. Raw dolomite is unprocessed and contains impurities. It is commonly used in the iron and steel industry as a flux material to remove impurities during the smelting process. Slightly burnt dolomite, on the other hand, is processed at low temperatures to reduce impurities, making it a more refined option for metallurgical applications.</p></p>
