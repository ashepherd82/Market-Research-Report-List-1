<p><h1>Gluten-free Diet Market Size and Growth, Market Segmentation, Regional and Country Breakdowns, and Market Trends for Period from 2023 -  2030</h1></p><p><strong>Market Overview and Report Coverage</strong></p>
<p><p>A gluten-free diet is a dietary approach that excludes the protein gluten, found in grains such as wheat, barley, and rye.

Gluten triggers an immune response in these individuals, damaging the small intestine and causing various symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.</p><p>The global gluten-free diet market has experienced significant growth in recent years and is expected to continue its upward trajectory in the future. This growth is driven by several factors, including the increasing prevalence of celiac disease and gluten-related disorders, growing consumer awareness regarding the benefits of gluten-free diets, and the availability of a wide range of gluten-free products.</p><p>Moreover, the market's expansion is further supported by the rising incidence of lifestyle-related disorders such as obesity and diabetes, as consumers are increasingly adopting gluten-free diets as a part of their overall health and wellness routines. Additionally, the food industry has been quick to respond to this growing demand by introducing innovative gluten-free alternatives and expanding the gluten-free product range.</p><p>According to the forecasted period, the gluten-free diet market is expected to maintain steady growth, with a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.9%. This positive outlook can be attributed to the continuous product development, improved distribution networks, and favorable government regulations supporting the gluten-free industry. However, challenges such as high product costs and limited availability in certain regions may slightly impede the market's growth.</p><p>Overall, the gluten-free diet market is poised for a prosperous future as it caters to the increasing demand for gluten-free products among individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and those seeking healthier dietary choices.</p></p>
