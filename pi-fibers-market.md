<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PI Fibers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Spinning</li><li>Dry Spinning</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>PI fibers, also known as polyimide fibers, are high-performance synthetic fibers widely used in various industries. There are two main market types for PI fibers: wet spinning and dry spinning. Wet spinning involves dissolving the polymer in a solvent and extruding it through a spinneret into a coagulating bath to form fibers. This method offers cost-effectiveness and is suitable for large-scale production. In contrast, dry spinning involves spinning the polymer solution into a coagulation medium through heated air, resulting in strong and heat-resistant fibers. Dry spinning is advantageous for producing fibers with specific characteristics and is commonly used in applications requiring exceptional thermal stability.</p></p>
