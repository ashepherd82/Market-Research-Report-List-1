<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The OLED Cellphone Display Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PMOLED</li><li>AMOLED</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The OLED cellphone display market consists of two main types: PMOLED (Passive Matrix OLED) and AMOLED (Active Matrix OLED). PMOLED displays are simpler and cheaper, making them suitable for smaller devices like MP3 players or small feature phones. On the other hand, AMOLED displays offer higher resolutions, better color reproduction, and are more energy-efficient, making them preferred for flagship smartphones. Both types use organic compounds that emit light when an electric current is applied, but AMOLED displays have a more complex design with an active matrix driving each individual pixel.</p></p>
