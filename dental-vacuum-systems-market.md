<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Vacuum Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I</li><li>Type II</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dental vacuum systems are categorized into two types - Type I and Type II. Type I systems, also known as central vacuum systems, are designed to provide suction for all dental units within a dental office. They consist of a central compressor and a network of pipes that distribute the suction power. On the other hand, Type II systems, also called portable units, are compact and individual devices that provide suction to a single dental unit. They are easier to install and are often used when a central vacuum system is not feasible.</p></p>
