<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Zeolite Adsorbents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Regenerative Zeolite Adsorbents</li><li>Non-regenerative Zeolite Adsorbents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Zeolite adsorbents are a type of material used for adsorption, which is the process of capturing and retaining molecules on the surface of a solid. There are two main types of zeolite adsorbents: regenerative and non-regenerative. Regenerative zeolite adsorbents can be reused through a process called regeneration, where the captured molecules are released from the surface of the material, making it ready for further use. Non-regenerative zeolite adsorbents, on the other hand, cannot be reused and need to be replaced once they have captured a sufficient amount of molecules.</p></p>
