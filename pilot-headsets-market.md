<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pilot Headsets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PNR headsets</li><li>ANR headsets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pilot headsets are categorized into two types: passive noise reduction (PNR) headsets and active noise reduction (ANR) headsets. PNR headsets are designed to block out ambient noise through passive insulation, allowing pilots to communicate clearly. On the other hand, ANR headsets use advanced technology to cancel out background noise electronically, enhancing audio clarity. PNR headsets are more affordable and widely used, while ANR headsets are more expensive but offer superior noise reduction, making them popular among pilots operating in noisy environments. Both types serve the purpose of improving communication and reducing fatigue during flights.</p></p>
