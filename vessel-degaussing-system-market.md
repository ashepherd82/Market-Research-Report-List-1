<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vessel Degaussing System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Degaussing System</li><li>Shipborne Degaussing System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Vessel Degaussing System market encompasses two main types: External Degaussing System and Shipborne Degaussing System. External Degaussing Systems are used to reduce the magnetic field of a vessel by placing energy coils on the external surface of the ship. This helps to neutralize the magnetic signature and protect the vessel from magnetic mines. On the other hand, Shipborne Degaussing Systems are installed inside the vessel and operate by generating opposite magnetic fields to offset the ship's own magnetic signature, ensuring its safety and effectiveness during operations.</p></p>
