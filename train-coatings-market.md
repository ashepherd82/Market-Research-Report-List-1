<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Train Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Primer</li><li>Top Coat</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The train coatings market comprises two major types: primer and top coat. Primers are applied as the initial layer to enhance adhesion between the train's surface and the subsequent coating layers. They also provide protection against corrosion, chemicals, and weather conditions. Top coats, on the other hand, are the final layers that offer aesthetic appeal, UV resistance, and protection against abrasion and fading. Both primer and top coat play crucial roles in ensuring the durability, appearance, and longevity of train coatings.</p></p>
