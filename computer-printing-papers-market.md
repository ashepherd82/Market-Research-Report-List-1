<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Computer Printing Papers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Layer</li><li>Multi-layer</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>In the computer printing papers market, there are two main types: single layer and multi-layer papers. Single layer papers are made up of a single layer of paper and are commonly used for general printing purposes. They are cost-effective and offer good print quality. On the other hand, multi-layer papers consist of multiple layers and are commonly used for receipts or invoices that require multiple copies. The top layer of the paper is coated with a special chemical that transfers information to the underlying layers when pressure is applied. These papers provide the convenience of duplicate or triplicate copies without the need for separate carbon sheets.</p></p>
