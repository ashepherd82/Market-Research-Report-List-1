<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bus Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias Tire</li><li>Radial Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bus tires are an important part of the automotive industry, and they come in two main types: bias tire and radial tire market. Bias tires are constructed with layers of ply cords laid at a diagonal angle to the tire's centerline. This design leads to increased sidewall flexibility but reduced tread durability. On the other hand, radial tires have ply cords that run perpendicular to the tire's centerline, resulting in greater tread durability, improved fuel efficiency, and enhanced tire life. These two types cater to different bus tire market segments with varying requirements and performance expectations.</p></p>
