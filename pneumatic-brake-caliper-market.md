<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Brake Caliper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Pneumatic Brake Caliper</li><li>Floating Pneumatic Brake Caliper</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Pneumatic Brake Caliper market includes two main types: fixed pneumatic brake caliper and floating pneumatic brake caliper. Fixed pneumatic brake calipers are directly mounted onto the brake rotor, providing a more stable and rigid structure. On the other hand, floating pneumatic brake calipers have one or more pistons that move within the caliper, allowing for better alignment with the brake rotor and reducing the risk of brake drag. Both types function using compressed air to generate the clamping force required for braking.</p></p>
