<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chemical Processing Catalyst Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Catalyst</li><li>Deactivation Catalyst</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Chemical processing catalysts can be classified into two types: active catalysts and deactivation catalysts. Active catalysts are substances that initiate and accelerate chemical reactions, enhancing the efficiency and yield of the process. They remain highly effective throughout the reaction process. On the other hand, deactivation catalysts are employed to control the activity of active catalysts by either slowing down or completely stopping the reaction. They are used to prevent undesired side reactions or achieve a specific product outcome. Both types play crucial roles in managing the desired chemical reactions during the processing of various substances.</p></p>
