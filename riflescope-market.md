<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Riflescope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Telescopic Sight</li><li>Collimating Optical Sight</li><li>Reflex Sight</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The riflescope market comprises three main types: telescopic sight, collimating optical sight, and reflex sight. Telescopic sight is a traditional riflescope that uses a series of lenses to magnify the target image, allowing for precise long-range shooting. Collimating optical sight, also known as red dot sight, uses a collimated reticle projected onto a lens, enabling users to quickly acquire targets and maintain situational awareness. Reflex sight, similar to collimating optical sight, projects a reticle onto a small mirror, providing a wide field of view for close-quarters shooting.</p></p>
