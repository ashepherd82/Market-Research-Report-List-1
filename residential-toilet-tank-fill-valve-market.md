<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Toilet Tank Fill Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Float Ball</li><li>Float Cup</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The residential toilet tank fill valve market is divided into two main types: float ball and float cup. Float ball fill valves feature a buoyant ball attached to an arm that rises as the water level in the tank decreases, activating the valve to allow water entry. On the other hand, float cup fill valves use a float cup instead of a ball, which rises and falls with the water level, sending signals to open or close the valve. Both types serve the purpose of regulating water flow in residential toilet tanks.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Residential Toilet Tank Fill Valve Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Two-Piece Toilet</li><li>One-Piece Toilet</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The residential toilet tank fill valve market is an essential component of both two-piece and one-piece toilets. Two-piece toilets are composed of a separate tank and bowl, and the fill valve is responsible for refilling the tank after each flush. One-piece toilets have a unified tank and bowl design, with the fill valve performing the same task. These valves play a crucial role in maintaining water levels in the toilet tank, ensuring efficient flushing and optimal functionality of both types of toilets.</p></p>
