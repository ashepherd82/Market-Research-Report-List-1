<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ventricular Drainage Tubes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ventricular</li><li>Peritoneal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ventricular drainage tubes are medical devices used to drain excess fluid from the brain's ventricles or the abdominal cavity. There are two main types of ventricular drainage tubes: ventricular and peritoneal. Ventricular drainage tubes are inserted into the ventricles of the brain to drain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), while peritoneal drainage tubes are placed in the abdominal cavity to remove excess fluid. Both types of tubes aid in alleviating conditions such as hydrocephalus or fluid accumulation caused by trauma or surgery.</p></p>
