<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Touch Screen Control System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resistive Touch Screen</li><li>Capacitive Touch Screen</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Vehicle Touch Screen Control System market comprises two types of touch screens: resistive touch screens and capacitive touch screens. A resistive touch screen is composed of multiple layers and requires physical pressure to register a touch. It is cost-effective but less responsive. On the other hand, a capacitive touch screen relies on the conductive properties of the human body to detect touch. It offers a more accurate and fast response, but at a higher cost. Both types cater to the needs of vehicle touch screen control systems, but differ in terms of functionality and price.</p></p>
