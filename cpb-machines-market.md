<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CPB Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Roller Pump</li><li>Double Roller Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CPB machines are used during cardiac surgery to temporarily support the patient's heart and lungs. There are two main types of CPB machines: single roller pump and double roller pump. Single roller pump machines use a single roller to pump blood through the system, while double roller pump machines use two rollers. Both types provide similar functions, but the double roller pump offers improved efficiency and more reliable flow rates. The choice between the two depends on the specific needs and preferences of the surgical team.</p></p>
