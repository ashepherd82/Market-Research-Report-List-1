<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Trailer Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Agriculture Tires</li><li>Bias (Crossply) Agriculture Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Agricultural Trailer Tyres market consists of two main types: Radial Agriculture Tires and Bias (Crossply) Agriculture Tires. Radial Agriculture Tires are designed with a radial ply construction, where the cords run radially from the bead to the tread. This design provides better traction, fuel efficiency, and tread wear resistance. On the other hand, Bias (Crossply) Agriculture Tires have a bias ply construction, where the cords crisscross at an angle from bead to bead. These tires are known for their durability, load-carrying capacity, and resistance to cuts and punctures.</p></p>
