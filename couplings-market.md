<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Shifting</li><li>Shifting</li><li>Hydrodynamic</li><li>Magnetic</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Couplings are mechanical devices that connect two rotating shafts to transmit power. Non-shifting couplings are rigid and provide a fixed connection between the shafts. Shifting couplings allow some misalignment between shafts and compensate for minor vibrations. Hydrodynamic couplings use a fluid-filled chamber to transmit torque smoothly and dampen shocks. Magnetic couplings transmit torque through magnetic attraction, without physical contact between the shafts. Each type of coupling serves different purposes in various industries, enabling efficient power transmission while accommodating misalignments, reducing vibrations, or ensuring maintenance-free operation in certain applications.</p></p>
