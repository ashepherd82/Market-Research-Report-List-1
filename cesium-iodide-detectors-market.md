<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cesium Iodide Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Cesium iodide detectors are used in medical imaging and security systems to detect radiation. Indirect conversion detectors contain a scintillator material, such as cesium iodide, which converts radiation into light. This light is then converted into an electrical signal by a photodetector. Direct conversion detectors, on the other hand, directly convert radiation into an electrical signal using a material, such as amorphous selenium. Both types offer advantages and disadvantages, but direct conversion detectors generally provide higher image quality and efficiency, while indirect conversion detectors are more cost-effective.</p></p>
