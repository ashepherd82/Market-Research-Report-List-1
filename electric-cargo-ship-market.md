<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Cargo Ship Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>All Electric</li><li>Diesel-electric Propelled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electric cargo ship market includes two main types of propulsion systems: all-electric and diesel-electric propelled ships. All-electric cargo ships are powered solely by electricity stored in batteries or generated from renewable sources, making them environmentally friendly with zero emissions. On the other hand, diesel-electric propelled ships use diesel engines to generate electricity, which is then used to power electric motors propelling the ship. While they are not as clean as all-electric ships, diesel-electric propelled ships offer the advantage of longer cruising distances and greater flexibility in terms of power generation.</p></p>
